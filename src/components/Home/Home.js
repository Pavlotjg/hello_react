            War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by
            the ruthless Sith Lord, Count Dooku. There are heroes
            on both sides. Evil is everywhere. In a stunning move,

            into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine,
            leader of the Galactic Senate. As the Separatist Droid Army
            attempts to flee the besieged capital with their valuable
            hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a desperate mission to rescue
            the captive Chancellor...
